This is a simple sound player library for Java and Scala applications.

Hopefully it's good for the occasions when you want to write simple
code to play a sound file:

  1) Specify the sound file location as a String.
  2) Play the sound file.

This code is unique in that it can play MP3 files as well as the usual
Java supported sound file types. This capability comes from the 
javazoom.com people.
